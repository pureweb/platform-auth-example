        h3 Agent Token
        p.Description Use the agent token to connect to the PureWeb platform as an agent to either consume or contribute data. 
        p.Description Agents automatically join the Agent Environment that the agent token belongs to. A typical Agent Environment might contain a cloud-based agent contributing an Unreal game stream and a browser agent consuming the stream. For basic streaming, you donâ€™t need to manually create agents. However, for more advanced integrations, such as when using an external data source, an agent may be required.
